# Silver Detection Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to classify mineral images
as containing silver or non-silver materials using supervised learning.

## Dataset
Images were collected from the Mindat.org database and organized into:
- silver/
- non_silver/

Metadata was stored in CSV and JSON formats.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing using Python
- Model training using CNN / Machine Learning classifiers
- Train/Validation/Test split: 70% / 15% / 15%

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- GitHub for version control
